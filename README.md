My first [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) app ðŸ¥³

Scrapes the top 10 articles from BBC News to bypass the front page and get right to the national zeitgeist.

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm start`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
